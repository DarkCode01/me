# (me) Personal Site 🇩🇴ƛ

Personal portfolio of **Jose Miguel Segura Polanco**. This project arises from the need to share a resource in which you can learn more about me, I hope you like it!

### Shell or MyTerm

MyTerm is a small replica of a terminal, in which you can run different commands to interact with my personal data, such as CV, Github, Linkedin, Email, etc ...

> Remember to have fun with this terminal 😁

#### Aviables Commands

These are the available commands so you can have fun::

**Commands to manage terminal or REPL**

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `me`              | Display my bio!                               | `~$ me`                                            |
| `get`             | Get informaion or URL's other accounts.       | `~$ get github` # return my github url.            |
| `open`            | Open on new tab my personals accounts or URL. | `~$ open github` # new tab with my github account. |

**Command combination with | (pipe command)**

The `pipe command` or `|` is in this terminal or REPL, you can use it to combine the commands and do more interactively.

Example:
* If you want to open my github profile, instead of executing the `open github` command.
* You can do it this way`get github | open` and it will open in the same way 😁, this is one of the secrets 😉
